abstract: 'This paper examines the relationship between language and knowledge in a learning model. An agent describes the world through theories. A theory consists of universal propositions called patterns, and it is formulated in some language. We look at two characteristics of a good theory. A theory is informative if it ensures correct predictions. A theory is brief if it consists of one pattern. We o§er di§erent characterizations of informative theories. In particular, we identify languages for which there is no trade-o§ between both characteristics: Any informative theory logically implies a theory that is informative as well as brief. The results are illustrated with speciÖc problems of reasoning under uncertainty.'

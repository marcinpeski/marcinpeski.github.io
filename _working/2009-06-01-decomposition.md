abstract: 'A joint distribution of an infinite collection of random variables \teta(x) for x \in X is exchangeable, if the joint distributions of any two finite tuples of variables of the same length are equal. A famous result by de Finetti shows that each random variable \teta(x) can be decomposed as an outcome of two kinds of independent shocks: an aggregate shock that affects all variables in the same way and a collection of i.i.d. idiosyncratic shocks that affect each variable separately. In this paper, we present a generalization of the de Finettis Theorem. We assume that all tuples of variables of a given length are divided into finitely many classes of analogy. A joint distribution of all random variables is invariant if the distributions of analogous tuples of variables are equal. Under the finite dimensionality assumption on the system of analogies, we show that each random variable \teta(x) can be decomposed into finitely many independent shocks. These may include the aggregate shock that aÂ§ects all variables, idiosyncratic shocks that affect each variable separately, and shocks that affect the non-trivial subset of variables.'

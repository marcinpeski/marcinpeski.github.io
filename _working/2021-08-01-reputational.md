abstract: "We study a reputational war-of-attrition bargaining over a pie with heterogeneous parts, incomplete information over preferences, and behavioral types. To screen across preference types, each player may demand that the opponent chooses from an arbitrary menu of offers. When there is one-sided uncertainty about preferences (and two-sided about the behavioral type), there is a unique limit equilibrium, in which the player with known preferences proposes a menu of all allocations that give him at least his worst complete information bargaining payoff. The outcome is ex ante and ex post efficient. Being able to commit to a menu instead of a single-offer increases equilibrium payoffs of the player with known preferences. Multiple equilibria are possible with two-sided incomplete information about preferences."

abstract: 'This paper studies a coordination process of a large population. We assume that subgroups of the population differ in the intensity of their coordination problems. Specifically, small (but not large) groups are able to coordinate and simultaneously take a coalitional best response an action, which improves the welfare of all the members of the group. When agents interact on a network, in the long-run they always play an
action which is either payoff- or risk-dominant. The outcome depends on the network. In general, the ability of small groups to coordinate may decrease the chances of selecting the efficient outcome. When players interact on many networks at the same time, the dynamics
may uniquely select an action, which is neither payoff nor risk dominant. This happens when such an action is sufficiently attractive for small groups. We characterize situations when efficiency is helped or obstructed by the presence of small groups. As an application, we discuss how networks of interactions may affect the probability of self-segregation and polarization.'

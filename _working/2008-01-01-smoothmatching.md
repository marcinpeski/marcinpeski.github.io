abstract: 'We analyze a continuous version of the Gale-Shapley matching problem. Men and women are represented by a d-dimensional vector of characteristics (such as intelligence, beauty, wealth, etc.) and their preferences over matches with the opposite sex depend only on the respective characteristics. We assume that preferences are monotonic. We show that each differentiable and pairwise stable matching has to satisfy a system of partial diÂ§erential equations. For generic values of parameters, there exists at most one smooth (i.e., analytic) stable matching.'

abstract: "A researcher wants to ask a decision-maker about a belief related to a choice the decision-maker made. When can the researcher provide incentives for the decision-maker to report her belief truthfully without distorting her choice? We identify which questions can be incentivized in this way in three canonical classes of problems. For these questions, we construct a simple mechanism the researcher can use."

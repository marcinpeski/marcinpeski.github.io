abstract: "We study elicitation of beliefs that are related to choices in a dynamic decision problem. We consider three cases with respect to the relationship between actions and beliefs: (i) beliefs are independent of actions, (ii) actions affect information but not the payoff-relevant state, and (iii) actions affect the distribution of states. In each case, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for incentivizing truthful reports of beliefs without distorting behavior in the original decision problem. For two-period decision problems, questions asked in the first period can be incentivized if and only if they are about expectations of payoffs plus some function of the belief, where the class of functions that can be added varies across the three cases.
    In contrast, incentivizing truthful reports in the second period always distorts incentives in the first period unless the first-period action affects neither the information nor the incentives in the second period."

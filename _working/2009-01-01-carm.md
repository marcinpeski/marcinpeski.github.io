abstract: "This paper analyzes asynchronous repeated games with private and rich monitoring. We assume that strategies have finite past, i.e., in each period, continuation strategies must be measurable with respect to finite partitions of past histories. This class includes Önite automata and bounded recall strategies. Additionally, we assume that the monitoring has an infinite number of signals. We show that any equilibrium with Önite past and generic infinite monitoring has to satisfy a version of the belief-free property: in each period t; the set of best responses does not depend on the information received before period t; with a possible exception of the information received in the first periods of the game. Under
an additional payo§ smoothness assumption, the equilibrium strategy are essentially pastindependent: each periodís action depends only on the  formation received immediately prior to the choice of the action."

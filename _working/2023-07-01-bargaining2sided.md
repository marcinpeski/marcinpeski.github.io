abstract: "I study a random proposer multi-round bargaining over a single good with transfers. In each round, a proposer may offer an arbitrary mechanism to determine the final allocation. If the offer is accepted, it is implemented and the game ends; otherwise, the next round commences. When there is a two-sided incomplete information with binary types for each player, the ex ante expected equilibrium payoffs are unique."

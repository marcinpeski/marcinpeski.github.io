abstract: "We study a model of random proposer bargaining over a single good with transfers. Players offer arbirtrary mechanisms. Each player has two (private valuation) types. We provide non-trivial payoff bounds that depend on the bargaining strngth of the player. For a large set of initial beliefs, the equilibrium payoffs are unique."

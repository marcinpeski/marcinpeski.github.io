abstract: "Abstract. I study a random proposer bargaining over a single good with transfers. When given an opportunity to make a proposal, players may offer an arbitrary mechanism to determine the final allocation. When there are two types for each player, I show the ex ante expected equilibrium payoffs are unique."

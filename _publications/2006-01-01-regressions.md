abstract: 'This paper is concerned with the problem of combining a data set that identifies the conditional distribution P(ylx) with one that identifies the conditional distriution P(zlx) to identify the regressions E(ylx,.) - [E(yjx, z =j),j E Z] when the conditional distribution P(y x, z) is unknown. Cross and Manski (2002, Econometrica 70, 357-368) studied this problem and showed that the identification region of E(y I x, -) can be precisely calculated when y has finite support. Here we generalize the result of Cross and Manski, showing that the identification region can be precisely calculated also in the case in which y has infinite '

abstract: 'This paper proposes two (ordinal and cardinal) generalizations of Harsanyi and Selten (1988) risk-dominance to multi-player, multi-action games. There are three reasons why generalized risk-dominance (GR-dominance) is interesting. Extending the logic of riskdominance, GR-dominant actions can be interpreted as best responses to conjectures that satisfy a certain type of symmetry. Second, in a local interaction game of Ellison (1993), if an action is risk-dominant in individual binary interactions with neighbors, it is also GRdominant in the large game on a network. Finally, we show that GR-dominant actions are stochastically stable under a class of evolutionary dynamics. The last observation is a corollary to new abstract selection results that applies to a wide class of so-called asymmetric
dynamics. In particular, I show that a (strictly) ordinal GR-dominant proÖle is (uniquely) stochastically stable under the approximate best-response dynamics of Kandori, Mailath, and Rob (1993). A (strictly) cardinal GR-dominant equilibrium is (uniquely) stochastically stable under a class of payo§-based dynamics that includes Blume (1993). Among others, this leads to a generalization of a result from Ellison (2000) on the 1/2-dominant evolutionary selection to all networks and the unique selection to all networks that satisfy a simple, sufficient condition.'

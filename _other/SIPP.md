In 2022, the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) changed the policy on admissions into high school specialized programs (policy <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fXkZ8KTrI5TwV0tQyKDIo1AWfrGuO-Z9/view'> P100</a>). The main change was to replace exams and auditions with a mandated randomized selection (a.k.a. lottery). An advocacy to revert this change became one of my past time projects. Here are highlights of my work:

- <a href='http://marcinpeski.github.io/files/TDSB.pdf'>Evaluation of changes to the Student
Interest Programs Policy</a>, March 2023
    - state of specialized programs before 2022 and the discussion of the changes to the policy. 
- Plagiarism and made-up citations in "Literature review on meritocracy", June 2023, <a href='https://www.soschools.ca/press-releases/2023-05-25-tdsb-fradulent-literature-review'>press release</a>
    - In May 2023, as a part of the implementation update, TDSB <a href='https://pub-tdsb.escribemeetings.com/FileStream.ashx?DocumentId=15555'>published (see Appendix B)</a> a review of scholarly literature, discussiong, but mostly criticizing, the idea of merit in public education.
    - It turns out that the scholarship was not great. As I have found, around <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wcRHwuvO0fWVukipjfgnuTgbkTPrVVz_/view'>20% citations</a> were fake and <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HOmUPUvpD7pwDUbppV_5Dp9LD46A27lA/view'>55% of the text</a> was plagiarized.

    - Although the TDSB has never confirmed that ChatGPT (released in the fall of 2022) was used in preperation of this report, I have managed to <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c9RO4X08hOhQ1TkVpMdelLDB0V65j4Ah/view?usp=drive_link'>replicate</a> some of the fake citations using ChatGPT. If that's correct, it would be the first publicly known case of use of ChatGPT to prepare an official government document.

    - We document a dramatic drop in the performance of TDSB students in UWaterloo math contest. We discuss various plausible explanations. The only explanation consistent with the data is the impact of the lottery.
